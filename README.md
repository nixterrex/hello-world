# hello-world
Hello, my name is Niko. I'm currently a cal state east bay student majoring in Business Administration with an option
in Information Technology. I also work at Amazon's warehouse as a sortation associate. On the side,
I'm trying to learn python through online channels in order to gather, clean, query, organize, and present data. I'm doing this because I don't learn enough from school and I've always been a self-teacher by way of learning from online channels. My career interests, as
you can tell, is in data science. I'm considering bootcamp for coding or data science somewhere online, but I like trying to atleast
accomplish teaching myself. Nothing beats progression in knowledge and accomplishing things on my lonesome :)
